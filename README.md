#### Project Overview

* We started with the problem statement: “What is there to do next weekend in Richmond?”; this is near and dear to our hearts as we have all experienced this

* We created a user interface for finding music/food & beverage/festivals/active activities and also delivered the capability to create your own events in the Richmond area

* Utilized APIs to pull images, event locations, date/times, descriptions, and weather

* Captured user data for create your own section using Firebase Database and Firebase Storage

#### Applications/APIs/Programs Used

1. Active API – Athletic events, such as running, cycling, triathlons, etc.

2. AJAX – To pull data from API

3. Bootstrap – Formatting of cards

4. Eventful API – Music, food & beverage events, festivals, etc.

5. Firebase Database – To store collect user input

6. Firebase Storage – To store user’s created event pictures

7. JavaScript/HTML/CSS/jQuery

8. JSON – To format API responses and create requests

9. Willy Weather Widget – So user can determine type of activity or event

10. Imbedded video 

#### Design Process

Came together to design the user experience and details that were must haves; user experience was our primary focus throughout this journey

Researched appealing color combinations to arrive at palate used in project

Along with our in-class time we also met out of class twice and used Slack/Trello to communicate about updates

Landed on using Bootstrap card instead of a list so that the content is displayed in a unique way

Researched multiple APIs before landing on a few where we could return meaningful data


#### Future Development

* We wanted user created events to be moderated by other users, but weren’t able to deliver; would like to add this at a later date

* We use the file name to access firebase storage but multiple files could be named the same thing; we want to include another way to index it

* We are able to allow user created events to add photos, but wanted to include those photos in the cards; we aren’t able to pull those photos from Firebase Storage currently, we want to resolve this

* Want to improve the design of our modal in future iteration
